**Bored of being _unruggable_?** Introducing Ruggable Meme, a project designed with somewhat security but still transparency at its core. Our degenz contracts ensure fair but secure experience for all users.

Become a meme lord and launch your riskiest memecoin with [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme)! And as a memecoin tradoor, you can use [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme) to check if a memecoin is ruggable before investing.

## BECOME RUGGABLE, HOW!? ðŸ‘‡

Before creating the token, meme lords must set a timer. When the timer ends, `RUG_IT` feature will be unlocked for the owner, who can decide to `RUG_IT` anytime. **BEWARE: MEME LORD CAN RUG ENTIRE LIQUIDITY POOL.** Watchout tradoors!

## UPCOMING FEATURES:

-   [ ] Smart contracts (In Development)
-   [ ] FE: Deploy flow for meme lords
-   [ ] FE: Flow for users to check Ruggable tokens
-   [ ] `RUG_IT` feature can be call by all token holders with some catch.
-   [ ] `UNRUG_CHALLENGE(s)` will be set by meme lords prelaunch and transparently with tradoors in order to further extend `RUG_IT` timer. **It's gonna be CRAZY!!!**
