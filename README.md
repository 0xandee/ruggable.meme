Tired of being _unruggable_? Introducing Ruggable Meme, a project designed with no security and no transparency at its core. Our degenz contracts ensure unfair but secure experience for all users.

Become a meme lord and launch your riskiest memecoin with [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme)! And as a memecoin tradoor, you can use [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme) to check if a memecoin is ruggable before investing.

## BECOME RUGGABLE HOW!? 👇

Before creating the token, the meme lord must set a timer. When the timer ends, `RUG_IT` function will be unlocked for the owner, who can decide to `RUG_IT` anytime.
