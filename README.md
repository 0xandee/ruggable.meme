Tired of being _unruggable_? Introducing Ruggable Meme, a project designed with somewhat security but still transparency at its core. Our degenz contracts ensure unfair but secure experience for all users.

Become a meme lord and launch your riskiest memecoin with [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme)! And as a memecoin tradoor, you can use [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme) to check if a memecoin is ruggable before investing.

## BECOME RUGGABLE, HOW!? 👇

Before creating the token, the meme lord must set a timer. When the timer ends, `RUG_IT` feature will be unlocked for the owner, who can decide to `RUG_IT` anytime. **MEME LORD CAN RUG ENTIRE LIQUIDITY POOL.** Watchout tradoors!

## TODO

-   [ ] Smart contracts (In Development)
-   [ ] FE: Deploy flow for meme lords
-   [ ] FE: Ruggable contract deploy flow for meme lords
-   [ ] `RUG_IT` feature can be call by all token holders with some catch.
-   [ ] Holders can achives `UNRUG_GOAL(s)` set by meme lords before launch and transparently with holders in order to further extend `RUG_IT` timer. **This goals will be REALLY CRAZY!!!**
