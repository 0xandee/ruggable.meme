Tired of being _unruggable_? Introducing Ruggable Meme, a project designed with somewhat security but still transparency at its core. Our degenz contracts ensure unfair but secure experience for all users.

Become a meme lord and launch your riskiest memecoin with [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme)! And as a memecoin tradoor, you can use [Ruggable Meme](https://ruggable.meme) to check if a memecoin is ruggable before investing.

## BECOME RUGGABLE, HOW!? ðŸ‘‡

Before creating the token, the meme lord must set a timer. When the timer ends, `RUG_IT` function will be unlocked for the owner, who can decide to `RUG_IT` anytime. **MEME LORD CAN RUG ENTIRE LIQUIDITY POOL.** Watchout tradoors!

## TODO

-   [ ] Ruggable smart contracts (I'm currently working on this)
-   [ ] Ruggable contract deploy flow
-   [ ] The `RUG_IT` function can be opened up to all token holders.
-   [ ] Specific quests can be implemented for holders can achives, which set by meme lords in order to further extend `RUG` timer.
